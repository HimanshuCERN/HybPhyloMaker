**Set of bash scripts for analysis of HybSeq data (from raw reads to species trees).** Consists of several steps:   
  

0:  Prepare FASTQ files to folder (optionally download files from Illumina BaseSpace storage)  
1:  Processing raw reads (PhiX removal, adaptor removal, quality filtering, summary statistics)  
2:  Mapping reads to reference (using Bowtie2/BWA), create consensus sequence  
3:  Recognize sequences matching probes (generate PSLX files using BLAT)  
4:  Create alignments for all genes (+ correct reading frame)  
5:  Treat missing data, select best genes  
6:  Generate FastTree or RAxML gene trees + calculate/plot trees-alignment properties  
7:  Root gene trees with outgroup, combine gene trees into a single file  
8:  Estimate species tree (ASTRAL, ASTRID, MRL, concatenation)  
9:  Subselect suitable genes and repeat steps 7+8  
10:Subselect trees based on samples presence, collapse unsupported branches  
  
Uses many additional software that must be installed and put in the PATH prior to run scripts (see [Table](docs/HybPhyloMaker_software.pdf) located in docs folder and consider to run {install_software.sh](install_software.sh)).  
Also utilizes many scripts developed by others (located in [HybSeqSource folder](HybSeqSource)). PLEASE CITE APPROPRIATELY THOSE SCRIPTS WHEN USING HybPhyloMaker!  

Read manual located in docs folder before running HybPhyloMaker.
